# 📊 Company Growth Analysis 2023

This is my **first data analysis project**, where I analyze the financial growth of a major tech company (Apple Inc.) over several years.

## 🧠 Goal of the Project
The main goal is to explore key financial indicators from 2009 to 2023 and understand how the company performed over time.

## 📁 Dataset
The dataset includes financial data such as:
- Market Capitalization
- Revenue
- Net Income
- Earnings Per Share (EPS)
- Return on Equity (ROE)
- Debt/Equity Ratio
- and more...

The data was sourced from a `.csv` file named `Financial statements 2023.csv`.

## 🔧 Tools Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas

## 📈 What I Did
- Loaded and previewed the dataset.
- Displayed the first few rows.
- Analyzed key financial metrics year by year.

> Note: This project is still under development. More visualizations and insights will be added soon.

## 🚀 Future Improvements
- Add graphs and visualizations (e.g., revenue growth, net income trends).
- Include markdown explanations and conclusions.
- Compare multiple companies (optional).

## 🙋‍♂️ About Me
I'm a beginner in data analysis and this is my first attempt at working with real-world financial data. More projects coming soon!
